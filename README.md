## Enhance i18n resource models with recursive key references within translated texts

This sample application showcases a solution to extend the resource model in order to enable interesting manipulations of the translated text. The source code includes the basic technique of replacing the resource model and proposes a mechanism which allows the use of keys inside texts. The ResourceModel provided in this app can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original ResourceModel.

*This is thought experiment and is not meant for production use!*
